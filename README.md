Elizabeth Sessa Used LLM for:
- Connecting the frontend and backend after we changed the backend (mostly pinpointing where we needed to change things in the frontend to accomodate and error navigation with that)
- Explaining how accessibility requirements will look for those who use them and implementing those into our frontend application
